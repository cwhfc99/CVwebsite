            <div class="contentHolder">
                <p>I am a highly motivated, hard-working, flexible and committed individual, with a keen interest in technology.  I consider myself a competent programmer, however I am keen to further my knowledge within a professional environment and have the opportunity to work on real-life projects.</p>
                <p id="aboutQuote">My aim is to one-day work on products that push the boundaries of what is believed possible with technology and create software that can change lives.</p>
                <p>I consider myself a very fast-learner and possess an entrepreneurial, forward-thinking mindset. I am a natural, systematic problem solver, with a solid grasp of mathematical concepts, and enjoy a challenge. When learning, I am keen to understand <i>why</i> things work the way they do, instead of just being content with knowing that they work. I believe this process makes me better equipped to solve problems of a similar nature in the future. I excel in teamwork due to my sociable, confident nature and strong communication skills (both verbal and written), yet am happy to work independently.</p>
                <p>My interest in technology steamed from an early age. Growing up I was fascinated with the way technology was developing and changing our day-to-day lives. Throughout school I developed my IT skills and gained an understanding of what was possible with technology and the role computing plays in society. Studying Computing Science in my senior years at school, I learnt the logical principles behind programming and developed a passion for software development, ultimately leading to me studying Computer Science at university.</p>
                <p>I hold a strong academic record and have completed University modules on a range of computing topics. I studied Computer Science with Games Development and I am predicting a 1st degree classification when I graduate in July 2020. This was essentially a general computer science course but with an emphasis on games development in the final year. Throughout this course I have had the pleasure of working on a variety of different software projects for different purposes, incorporating a range of development techniques and tools.</p>
                <p>Whilst at university, I have maintained part-time work in the hospitality industry and believe I have developed a number of transferable skills, notably communication skills and superb work ethic. Within this role, I have achieved a number of awards including ‘Employee of the Year’ and prior to the completion of my degree, I was selected to undertake training to become a shift manager on the basis I am a trustworthy, hard-working and competent employee. <a href="#workEx" onclick="buttonScrollFunc()" class="workExLink">Click here</a> to see my full employment history.</p>
                <p>In my personal life, I have a passion for sport. I enjoy playing football and have developed extensive teamwork and leadership skills through this. I have had the privilege to play for a number of excellent teams and have been complimented on my professionalism and dedication at each team. As goalkeeper, I captained my school side in my final year at school and currently am vice-captain for my university side. In both 2016 and 2017, I was selected to play for the Scottish Independent Schools Football Association’s U18 team and maintain an unbeaten record against our English counterparts during the annual international match, including a first ever away victory for a Scottish side in this fixture. I consider myself a sociable, outgoing person with a good sense of humour.</p>
                <p>I have held a full UK drivers license since 2017.</p>

                    Whilst I do not yet have any experience within the software or web development industry, I have worked, in some capacity, since the age of just 12 and believe I have attained a number of transferable skills.
                    I was dedicated to an early morning paper round for 5 years before working part-time for Deliveroo in my final year at school. Throughout my time at university I worked in a late-night bar and a number of the parent companies' surrounding venues.
                    With this company, I was in the process of being trained as a shift manager prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, and subsequent relocation back to Edinburgh, and was a commendable and trustworthy employee for this business. Over summers, I worked in venues during the Edinburgh Festival as a bartender in both a temporary beer garden and an upmarket, city-centre restaurant, excelling in both. Over the past three years I developed a remarkable competency in these roles, for someone of my age, and attribute my outgoing, sociable personality and abilty to work under pressure to these jobs.

I was employed full-time for the duration of the festival.
                                                As a multi-bar venue, effective communication was essential as radios were regularly used to communicate with colleagues in order to keep service efficient.
                                                Given my experience, I was often tasked with supervising one of the smaller bars, leading colleagues with little bar experience. This was a busy faced-paced environment and I believe my ability to work under pressure shone.
                                                My outgoing personality helped make customers, many tourists, welcome to both the venue and Edinburgh in general.

                        <p>
                            My final year university dissertation is largest and most complex project I have worked on. I opted to undertake a software engineering project and was tasked with researching, designing, implementing, testing, evaluating and reporting on, an innovating product. I chose to create a web-based system aimed at the education.
                            The idea was to use a game to motivate students instead of educate. I create an integrated database-driven RPG game and digitalised classroom reward system, whereby a teacher could reward students with in-game currency for real-life classroom activities, in an attempt to facilitate extrinsic motivation.
                            The product created is a prototype which lacks suitable graphics and scalability to be a commercially viable product, but serves as a proof of concept and a demonstration of my technical ability.
                            The system is written predominately in PHP/JavaScript/HTML/CSS and is driven by a PhpMyAdmin database. It has not been created using any web templates or frameworks, but does make use of open-source PHP libraries.

                            <i>Abstract from accompanying project report.</i><br>
                            This report documents the process of developing a product that pairs a digital classroom reward system with a computer game. It outlines the Research, Design, Development and Evaluation phases completed in the creation of a web-based prototype.
                            It also includes all the design and testing documentation produced throughout this process.
                            The product incorporates a database- driven RPG game, with teachers able to reward students with in-game currency, with the intention of providing extrinsic motivation within an educational context.
                            An understanding of how motivation is created, from a psychological perspective, is explained.
                            Many technical software development decisions are discussed in this report, with notable relevance to PHP and database design, along with theoretical ideas/features discovered from relevant literature and analysis of existing systems.
                            User evaluation was conducted to assist with the evaluation of the project and this is documented.
                            The report concludes by offering the findings from the project and suggestions for future development projects, within the field of E-learning, with pertinence to an innovative game-based approach to the creation of educational/motivation software and the design of an intuitive, easy-to-use reward allocation system.

                        <p>
                            I have chosen to include this website as part of my portfolio as a demonstration of web development capabilities.
                            From a design point of view, I wanted this site to feel like a continuation of my CV. The theme is the same as my CV and I have chosen to keep all the content on the same page so that it reads like a more detailed version of my CV.
                            This is designed like this to make it as easy as possible for the user to find the information they want.
                            Items that are not as important are initially hidden from the user, so they are not completely swamped with information.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From a technical point of view, the site is written in HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
                            I'm aware I could have used a web template or framework, but I was keen to demonstrate my problem solving skills and created all the scrolling animations using vanilla JavaScript.
                            I consider this static website to be rather basic, but it serves it's purpose well.
